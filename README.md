## valentin's website

In order to promote myself better, I finally created my online resume and portfolio.
I decided to let this repository public because the website itself is portfolio material.

The result of my work is visible [here](https://www.valentinvannay.com).

The website is written in PHP 7 and uses no frameworks.
